\declaremodule{extension}{telephone}
\platform{S60}
\modulesynopsis{A telephone related services package.}

This module provides an API to a telephone. 

Since the users of the device can also hang-up the phone explicitly, they 
might affect the current status of the call. In addition, using this 
extension in an emulator has no effect since no calls can be connected.

The \module{telephone} module has the following functions:

\begin{funcdesc}{dial}{number}

Dials the number set in \var{number}. \var{number} 
is a string, for example \code{u'+358501234567'} where \code{'+'} is the 
international prefix, \code{'358'} is the country code, \code{'50'} is 
the mobile network code (or the area code), and \code{'1234567'} is the 
subscriber number. If there is an ongoing phone call prior to calling 
\method{dial} from Python, then the earlier call is put on hold and a new 
call is established. Calling \method{dial} multiple times when, for example, 
the first call has been answered and a line has been established results in 
subsequent calls not being connected.
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{hang\_up}{}
Hangs up if a call initiated by \method{dial} is in process. If this call 
has already been finished, \exception{SymbianError: KErrNotReady} is raised.
\end{funcdesc}
