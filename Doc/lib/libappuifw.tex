	 Interface to the S60 GUI framework}

\declaremodule{standard}{appuifw}
\platform{S60}
\modulesynopsis{Interface to the S60 GUI framework}

The \module{appuifw} module offers an interface to S60 UI application
framework. \figurename~\ref{fig:ui-overview} provides an overview of
the Python for S60 environment for UI application programming.

\note{The services of this interface may only be used in the context of 
the main thread, that is, the initial thread of a UI application script.}

\label{fig:ui-overview}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Basics of appuifw Module}
\label{subsec:basics}
Figure \ref{fig:normal-uilayout} shows the layout of a S60 application 
UI in the normal screen mode and a summary of how it relates to the services 
available at the \module{appuifw} API. For alternative layouts, see 
Figure \ref{fig:alternate-uilayouts}.

\label{fig:normal-uilayout}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

\caption{UI layouts. left: 'normal', middle: 'large', right: 'full'}
\label{fig:alternate-uilayouts}
\end{figure}

The main application window may be set up to be occupied by a UI control.

A multi-view application can show the different views as tabs in the 
navigation pane and react as the users navigate between tabs. 

Dialogs always take precedence over the usual UI controls and appear on top 
of them.

UI controls are implemented as Python types. These types are available:

\begin{itemize}
\item \class{Text}
\item \class{Listbox}
\item \class{Canvas}
\end{itemize}
UI controls appear on the screen as soon as an instance of the corresponding 
Python type is created and set to the body field (\var{app.body}) of the 
current application UI.

\class{Form} is a versatile dialog implemented as a type.

The \class{Content_handler} type facilitates interfacing to other UI
applications and common high-level UI components. It is based on the
notion that designated handlers can reduce UI application interaction
to operations on MIME-type content.

The following dialogs are implemented as functions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \function{note}
\item \function{query}
\item \function{multi_query}
\item \function{selection_list}
\item \function{multi_selection_list}
\item \function{popup_menu}
\end{itemize}
A dialog becomes visible as soon as the corresponding Python function has 
been called. The function returns with the eventual user input or 
information on the cancellation of the dialog. \class{Form} is an 
exception; it is shown when its \method{execute} method is called.

\subsection{Softkeys}
\label{subsec:softkeys}
The softkeys are managed by the underlying S60 Platform. When no
dialog is visible, the right softkey is bound to application exit and
the left one represents an Options menu. Python for S60 offers
an interface for manipulating the menu and for binding the Exit key to
a Python-callable object (see Section \ref{subsec:application}). 

The native code that implements a dialog also manages the softkeys of the 
dialog, typically OK and Cancel. When the user input needs to be validated 
before accepting it and dismissing the dialog, it is best to use 
\class{Form}.

\subsection{Module Level Functions}
\label{subsec:module}
The following free functions - functions that do not belong to any class 
- are defined in the \module{appuifw} module:

\begin{funcdesc}{available_fonts}{}
Returns a list (Unicode) of all fonts available in the device.
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{query}{label, type\optional{, initial_value}}
Performs a query with a single-field dialog. The prompt is set to 
\var{label}, and the type of the dialog is defined by \var{type}. The 
value of \var{type} can be any of the following strings:

\begin{itemize}
\item \code{'text'}
\item \code{'code'}
\item \code{'number'}
\item \code{'date'}
\item \code{'time'}
\item \code{'query'}
\item \code{'float'}
\end{itemize}

The type of the optional \var{initial_value} parameter and the 
returned input depend on the value of \var{type}:

\begin{itemize}
\item For text fields, (\code{'text'}, \code{'code'}) it is Unicode
\item For number fields, it is numeric
\item For date fields, it is seconds since epoch rounded down to the nearest local midnight
\end{itemize}

A simple confirmation query and time query take no initial value and return 
\code{True/None} and seconds since local midnight, correspondingly. All 
queries return \code{None} if the users cancel the dialog. 

For \code{'float'} query the \var{initial_value} setting has no 
effect.
\end{funcdesc}


\begin{funcdesc}{multi_query}{label_1, label_2}
A two-field text (Unicode) input dialog. Returns the inputted values
as a 2-tuple. Returns \code{None} if the users cancel the dialog.
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{note}{text\optional{, type\optional{, global}}}
Displays a note dialog of the chosen type with \var{text} 
(Unicode). The default value for \var{type} is \code{'info'}, which is 
automatically used if \var{type} is not set. \var{type} can be one of 
the following strings: \code{'error'}, \code{'info'}, or 
\code{'conf'}. 

If \var{global} (integer) is any other value than zero a global note is 
displayed. A global note is displayed even if the Python application calling 
this function is in background. The same set of \var{type}s is supported as in 
standard note.
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{popup_menu}{list\optional{, label}}
A pop-up menu style dialog. \var{list} representing the menu 
contents can be a list of Unicode strings or a list of Unicode string pairs 
(tuples). The resulting dialog list is then a single-style or a double-style 
list. A single-style list is shown in full; whereas a double-style list 
shows the items one at a time. Returns \code{None} if the user cancels the 
operation.
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{selection_list}{choices\optional{, search_field=0}}
Executes a dialog that allows the users to select a list item and
returns the \var{index} of the chosen item, or \code{None} if the
selection is cancelled by the users. \var{choices} is a list of
Unicode strings.
\var{search_field} is \code{0} (disabled) by default and is optional. Setting it to \code{1} enables a search field (find pane) that facilitates searching for items in long lists. If enabled, the search field appears after you press a letter key.
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{multi_selection_list}{choices\optional{, style='checkbox', search_field=0}}
  Executes a dialog that allows the users to select multiple list
  items.  Returns a tuple of indexes (a pair of Unicode strings) of
  the chosen items, or \code{None} if the selection is cancelled by
  the users. \var{choices} is a list of Unicode strings.  \var{style}
  is an optional string; the default value being \code{'checkbox'}.
  If \code{'checkbox'} is given, the list will be a checkbox list,
  where empty checkboxes indicate what items can be marked. The other
  possible value that can be set for \var{style} is
  \code{'checkmark'}. If \code{'checkmark'} is given, the list will be
  a markable list, which lists items but does not indicate
  specifically that items can be selected. To select items on a
  markable list, use the Navigation key to browse the list and the
  Edit key to select an item. For example views on checkbox and
  markable lists, see
  \figurename~\ref{fig:checkbox-and-markable-list}.
  \var{search_field} is \code{0} (disabled) by default and is
  optional. Setting it to \code{1} enables a search field (find pane)
  that facilitates searching for items in long lists. If enabled, the
  search field is always visible with checkbox lists; with markable
  lists it appears by pressing a letter key.

Example:
\begin{verbatim}
tuple = appuifw.multi_selection_list(L, style='checkmark', search_field=1)
\end{verbatim}
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=\screenwidth]{markable-list}
\caption{Examples of a checkbox list (left) and a markable list (right)}
\label{fig:checkbox-and-markable-list}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Application Type}
\label{subsec:application}
A single implicit instance of this type always exists when \module{appuifw} 
module is present and can be referred to with the name \code{app}. New 
instances cannot be created by a Python program.

\begin{classdesc*}{Application}
Instances of \class{Application} type have the following attributes:

\begin{memberdesc}[Application]{body}
The UI control that is visible in the application's main window. Currently 
either \class{Text}, a \class{Listbox} object, \class{Canvas}, or 
\code{None}.
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}[Application]{exit_key_handler}
A callable object that is called when the user presses the Exit softkey. 
Setting \member{exit_key_handler} to \code{None} sets it back to the 
default value.
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}[Application]{menu}
This is a list of the following kinds of items:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{(title, callback)} which creates a regular menu item
\item \code{(title, ((title, callback)\optional{...}))} which creates a submenu
\end{itemize}

\var{title} (Unicode) is the name of the item and \var{callback} the associated callable object. 
The maximum allowed number of items in a menu, or items in a submenu,
or submenus in a menu is 30.

Example:
\begin{verbatim}
appuifw.app.menu = [(u"Item 1", item1),
                    (u"Submenu 1", 
                        ((u"Subitem 1", subitem1),
                         (u"Subitem 2", subitem2)))]
\end{verbatim}
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}[Application]{screen}
The screen area used by an application. See \figurename~\ref{fig:alternate-uilayouts} for
example screens. The appearance of the application on the screen can
be affected by setting one of the following values: \code{'normal'},
\code{'large'}, and \code{'full'}.

Examples:
\begin{verbatim}
appuifw.app.screen='normal' # (a normal screen with title pane and softkeys)
appuifw.app.screen='large'  # (only softkeys visible)
appuifw.app.screen='full'   # (a full screen)
\end{verbatim}
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}[Application]{title}
The title the application that is visible in the application's title
pane. Must be Unicode.
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}[Application]{focus}
A callable object that is called with integer as parameter (0 = focus lost, 
1 = focus regained) when the application receives focus or it is switched to 
background. Focus is received e.g. when the application is switched from 
background to foreground or when the focus is regained from screensaver. 
Similarly when the screensaver is displayed, focus is lost.

Examples:
\begin{verbatim}
>>> import appuifw
>>> def cb(fg):
...   if(fg):
...     print "foreground"
...   else:
...     print "background"
...
>>> appuifw.app.focus=cb
>>> # switch to background, following text is printed from callback:
>>> background
>>> # switch to foreground, following text is printed from callback:
>>> foreground
\end{verbatim}

\begin{notice}
An improper callback can cause adverse effects. If you, for example,
define a callback which takes no parameters you will receive
never-ending \exception{TypeError} exceptions on the Nokia 6600.
\end{notice}

\end{memberdesc}

Instances of \class{Application} type have the following methods:

\begin{methoddesc}[Application]{activate_tab}{index}
Activates the tab \var{index} counting from zero.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[Application]{full_name}{}
Returns the full name, in Unicode, of the native application in whose 
context the current Python interpreter session runs.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[Application]{set_exit}{}
Requests a graceful exit from the application as soon as the current script 
execution returns.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[Application]{set_tabs}{tab_texts\optional{,callback=None}}
Sets tabs with given names on them in the navigation bar; 
\var{tab_texts} is a list of Unicode strings. When the users 
navigate between tabs, \var{callback} gets called with the index 
of the active tab as an argument. Tabs can be disabled by giving an empty or 
one-item \var{tab_texts} list.
\end{methoddesc}

\end{classdesc*}

\subsection{Form Type}
\label{subsec:form}
\class{Form} implements a dynamically configurable, editable multi-field 
dialog. \class{Form} caters for advanced dialog use cases with requirements 
such as free selectability of the combination of fields, possibility of 
validating the user input, and automatically producing the contents of some 
dialog fields before allowing the closing of the dialog. 

\begin{classdesc}{Form}{fields\optional{, flags=0}}
Creates a \class{Form} instance.
\var{fields} is a list of \emph{field descriptors}: \code{(label, type\optional{, value})} where

\var{label} is a Unicode string

\var{type} is one of the following strings: 
\code{'text'}, \code{'number'}, \code{'date'}, \code{'time'}, \code{'combo'}
or \code{'float'}

\var{value}, depending on \var{type}: Unicode string, numeric, float (seconds 
since Unix epoch rounded down to the nearest local midnight), float (seconds 
since local midnight), \code{([choice_label ...], index)} of float. For 
\code{'float'} \var{type} the initial value setting might not be shown in the 
UI.
\end{classdesc}

\class{Form} can also be configured and populated after construction. The 
configuration flags are visible as an attribute. \class{Form} implements 
the list protocol that can be used for setting the form fields, as well as 
obtaining their values after the dialog has been executed.

Instances of \class{Form} type have the following attributes:

\begin{memberdesc}[Form]{flags}
This attribute holds the values of the various configuration flags. 
Currently supported flags are:

\begin{datadesc}{FFormEditModeOnly}
When this flag is set, the form remains in edit mode while \method{execute} 
runs.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{FFormViewModeOnly}
When this flag is set, the form cannot be edited at all.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{FFormAutoLabelEdit}
This flag enables support for allowing the end-users to edit the labels of 
the form fields.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{FFormAutoFormEdit}
This flag enables automatic support for allowing the end-users to add and 
delete the form fields. Note that this is an experimental feature and is not 
guaranteed to work with all SDK versions.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{FFormDoubleSpaced}
When this flag is set, double-spaced layout is applied when the form is 
executed: one field takes two lines, as the label and the value field are on 
different lines.
\end{datadesc}
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}[Form]{menu}
A list of \code{(title, callback)} pairs, where 
each pair describes an item in the form's menu bar that is active while the 
dialog is being executed. \var{title} (Unicode) is the name of 
the item and \var{callback} the associated callable object.
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}[Form]{save_hook}
This attribute can be set to a callable object that receives one argument 
and returns a Boolean value. It gets called every time the users want to 
save the contents of an executing \class{Form} dialog. A candidate list for 
new form content - a list representing the currently visible state of the 
UI - is given as an argument. The list can be modified by 
\member{save_hook}. If \member{save_hook} returns \code{True}, the 
candidate list is set as the new contents of the form. Otherwise, the form 
UI is reset to reflect the field list contained in \class{Form} object.
\end{memberdesc}

Instances of \class{Form} type have the following methods:

\begin{methoddesc}[Form]{execute}{}
Executes the dialog by making it visible on the UI.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[Form]{insert}{index, field_descriptor}
Inserts the field descriptor into the \class{Form} before the given \var{index}.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[Form]{pop}{}
Removes the last field descriptor from the \class{Form} and returns it.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[Form]{length}{}the number of field descriptors in the form.
\end{methoddesc}

The subscript notation \code{f[i]} can be used to access or modify the
i-th element of the form \code{f}. Same limitations as discussed above
in the context of the flag \constant{FFormAutoFormEdit} apply to
modifying a form while it is executing. The ability to change the
schema of a form while it is executing is an experimental feature.

\subsection{Text Type}
\label{subsec:mylabel5}
\class{Text} is a text editor UI control. For examples on the options 
available with \class{Text}, see Figure \ref{fig:text-styles}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\screenwidth]{text-styles-1}
\includegraphics[width=\screenwidth]{text-styles-2}
\caption{Examples of the options available for Text type}
\label{fig:text-styles}
\end{figure}

Instances of \class{Text} type have the following attributes:

\begin{memberdesc}[Text]{color}
The color of the text. \code{color} supports the same color representation 
models as the \module{graphics} module. For the supported color 
representation models, see Section \ref{sec:graphics}.
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}[Text]{focus}
A Boolean attribute that indicates the focus state of the control. Editor 
control also takes the ownership of the navigation bar, and this feature is 
needed to enable the usage of this control in applications that use the 
navigation bar - for example, navigation tabs.
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}[Text]{font} 
The font of the text. There are two possible ways to set this attribute:

\begin{itemize}

\item Using a supported Unicode font, for example \code{u"Latin12"}. Trying to set a font which is not supported by the device has no effect. A list of supported fonts can be retrieved by using \function{appuifw.available_fonts}.

Example, setting font:
\begin{verbatim}
t = appuifw.Text()
t.font = u"albi17b" # sets font to Albi 17 bold
t.font = u"LatinPlain12" # sets font to Latin Plain 12
\end{verbatim}
\item Using one of the default device fonts that are associated with the following labels (plain strings):
\code{'annotation', 'title', 'legend', 'symbol', 'dense', 'normal'}
Example, setting font: 
\begin{verbatim}
t.font = "title" # sets font to the one used in titles
\end{verbatim}

Example, checking the currently set font: 
\begin{verbatim}
unicodeFont = t.font
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

The attribute value retrieved is always a Unicode string. If the font has 
been set with a label, for example, \code{'title'}, the attribute will 
retrieve the font associated with that label. 
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}[Text]{highlight_color}
The highlight color of the text. \code{highlight_color} supports the 
same color representation models as the \module{graphics} module. For the 
supported color representation models, see Section \ref{sec:graphics}.
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}[Text]{style}
The style of the text. The flags for this attribute are defined in the 
\module{appuifw} module. These flags can be combined by using the binary 
operator \code{|}. The flags can be divided into two types: text style 
and text highlight. Text style flags can be freely combined with each other. 
However, one or more text style flags can be combined with only one text 
highlight flag. The flags are:

Text style:

\begin{datadesc}{STYLE_BOLD} 
Enables bold text.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{STYLE_UNDERLINE}
Enables underlined text.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{STYLE_ITALIC} 
Enables italic text.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{STYLE_STRIKETHROUGH } 
Enables strikethrough.
\end{datadesc}

Text highlight:

\begin{datadesc}{HIGHLIGHT_STANDARD}
Enables standard highlight.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{HIGHLIGHT_ROUNDED}
Enables rounded highlight.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{HIGHLIGHT_SHADOW}
Enables shadow highlight.
\end{datadesc}

Only one highlight is allowed to be used at once. Therefore, it is possible 
to combine only one highlight with one or more text styles.

Examples:
\begin{verbatim}
t = appuifw.Text()

# These and other similar values and combinations are valid:
t.style = appuifw.STYLE_BOLD
t.style = appuifw.STYLE_UNDERLINE
t.style = appuifw.STYLE_ITALIC
t.style = appuifw.STYLE_STRIKETHROUGH
t.style = (appuifw.STYLE_BOLD|
	   appuifw.STYLE_ITALIC|
	   appuifw.STYLE_UNDERLINE)

# These values are valid:
t.style = appuifw.HIGHLIGHT_STANDARD
t.style = appuifw.HIGHLIGHT_ROUNDED
t.style = appuifw.HIGHLIGHT_SHADOW

# This combination is NOT valid:
# Invalid code, do not try!
t.style = (appuifw.HIGHLIGHT_SHADOW|appuifw.HIGHLIGHT_ROUNDED)
\end{verbatim}
\end{memberdesc}

Instances of \class{Text} type have the following methods:

\begin{methoddesc}[Text]{add}{text}
Inserts the Unicode string \var{text} to the current cursor position.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[Text]{bind}{event_code, callback}
Binds the callable Python object \var{callback} to event
\var{event_code}. The key codes are defined in 
the \module{key_codes} library module. The call 
\code{bind(event_code, None)} clears an 
existing binding. In the current implementation the event is always
passed also to the underlying native UI control.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[Text]{clear}{}
Clears the editor.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[Text]{delete}{\optional{pos=0, length=len()}}
Deletes \var{length} characters of the text held by the editor control, 
starting from the position \var{pos}.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[Text]{get_pos}{}
Returns the current cursor position.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[Text]{len}{}
Returns the length of the text string held by the editor control.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[Text]{get}{\optional{pos=0, length=len()}}
Retrieves \code{length} characters of the text held by the editor control, 
starting from the position \var{pos}.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[Text]{set}{text}
Sets the text content of the editor control to Unicode string 
\var{text}.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[Text]{set_pos}{cursor_pos}
Sets the cursor to \var{cursor_pos}.
\end{methoddesc}

\subsection{Listbox Type}
\label{subsec:listbox}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\screenwidth]{listbox-with-icons}
\caption{Listbox with icons}
\label{fig:listbox-with-icons}
\end{figure}

An instance of this UI control type is visible as a listbox, also known as a 
list in Symbian, that can be configured to be a single-line item or a 
double-item listbox. Figure \ref{fig:listbox-with-icons} shows a single-line 
item Listbox with icons. For more information on the MBM and MIF formats, 
see Section \ref{subsec:icon}.

\begin{classdesc}{Listbox}{list, callback}
Creates a \class{Listbox} instance. A callable object 
\var{callback} gets called when a listbox selection has been 
made. \code{list} defines the content of the listbox and can be one of the 
following:

\begin{itemize}
\item A normal (single-line item) listbox: a list of Unicode strings, for example \code{[unicode_string item1, unicode_string item2]}
\item A double-item listbox: a two-element tuple of Unicode strings , for example \code{[(unicode_string item1, unicode_string item1description), (unicode_string item2, unicode_string item2description)]}
\item A normal (single-line item) listbox with graphics: a two-element tuple consisting of a Unicode string and an \class{Icon} object, for example \code{[(unicode_string item1, icon1), (unicode_string item2, icon2)]}.
\item A double-item listbox with graphics: a three-element tuple consisting of two Unicode strings and one \class{Icon} object, for example \code{[(unicode_string item1, unicode_string item1description, icon1), (unicode_string item2, unicode_string item2description, icon2)]}
\end{itemize}

Example: To produce a normal (single-line item) listbox with graphics:
\begin{verbatim}
icon1 = appuifw.Icon(u"z:\\system\\data\\avkon.mbm", 28, 29)
icon2 = appuifw.Icon(u"z:\\system\\data\\avkon.mbm", 40, 41)
entries = [(u"Signal", icon1),
           (u"Battery", icon2)]
lb = appuifw.Listbox(entries, lbox_observe)
\end{verbatim}
\end{classdesc}

Instances of \class{Listbox} type have the following methods:

\begin{methoddesc}[Listbox]{bind}{event_code, callback}
Binds the callable Python object \var{callback} to event 
\var{event_code}. The key codes are defined in 
the \module{key_codes} library module. The call
\code{bind(event_code, None)} clears an 
existing binding. In the current implementation the event is always passed 
also to the underlying native UI control.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[Listbox]{current}{}
Returns the currently selected item's index in the \class{Listbox}.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[Listbox]{set_list}{list\optional{, current}}
Sets the \class{Listbox} content to a list of Unicode strings or a
list of tuples of Unicode strings. The accepted structures of \var{list} are the
same as in the \class{Listbox} constructor. The optional argument \var{current} is the index of the focused list item.
\end{methoddesc}

\subsection{Icon Type}
\label{subsec:icon}
An instance of \class{Icon} type encapsulates an icon to be used together 
with a \class{Listbox} instance. Note that currently \class{Icon} can only 
be used with \class{Listbox} (see Section \ref{subsec:listbox}).

MBM is the native Symbian OS format used for pictures. It is a
compressed file format where the files can contain several bitmaps and
can be referred to by a number. An \code{.mbg} file is the header file
usually associated with an \code{.mbm} file, which includes symbolic
definitions for each bitmap in the file. For example, an
\file{avkon.mbm} file has an associated index file called
\file{avkon.mbg}, which is included in S60 SDKs. For more information
on the MBM format and the bitmap converter tool, see \cite{S60Doc} and
search the topics with the key term "How to provide Icons"; this topic
also points you to the Bitmap Converter tool that can be used for
converting bitmaps into the MBM format.

S60 2$^{nd}$ Edition FP3 introduces a new format for icons called 
Multi-Image File (MIF). This format is very similar to the MBM format and 
also contains several compressed files. The files to be compressed should be 
in Scalable Vector Graphics Tiny (SVG-T) format. For more information on the 
SVG format, see Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 1.1 Specification 
[10].

\begin{classdesc}{Icon}{filename, bitmap, bitmapMask}
Creates an icon. \var{filename} is a Unicode file name and must 
include the whole path. Note that MBM and MIF (MIF only in S60 2nd 
Edition FP3) are the only file formats supported. \var{bitmap} 
and \var{bitmapMask} are integers that represent the index of 
the icon and icon mask inside that file respectively.
\end{classdesc}

Example: The following builds an icon with the standard signal symbol:
\begin{verbatim}
icon = appuifw.Icon(u"z:\\system\\data\\avkon.mbm", 28, 29)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Content_handler Type}
\label{subsec:content}

An instance of \class{Content_handler} handles data content by its MIME 
type.

\begin{classdesc}{Content_handler}{\optional{callback}}
Creates a \class{Content_handler} instance. A Content_handler handles
data content by its MIME type. The optional
\var{callback} is called when the embedded handler application 
started with the \method{open} method finishes. 
\end{classdesc}

Instances of \class{Content_handler} type have the following methods:

\begin{methoddesc}[Content_handler]{open}{filename}
Opens the file \var{filename} (Unicode) in its handler 
application if one has been registered for the particular MIME type. The 
handler application is embedded in the caller's thread. The call to this 
function returns immediately. When the handler application finishes, the 
\var{callback} that was given to the \class{Content_handler} 
constructor is called.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[Content_handler]{open_standalone}{filename}
Opens the file \var{filename} (Unicode) in its handler 
application if one has been registered for the particular MIME type. The 
handler application is started in its own process. The call to this function 
returns immediately. Note that \var{callback} is not called for 
applications started with this method.
\end{methoddesc}

\subsection{Canvas Type}
\label{subsec:canvas}
\class{Canvas} is a UI control that provides a drawable area on the screen 
and support for handling raw key events. \class{Canvas} supports the 
standard drawing methods that are documented in Section \ref{sec:graphics}.

\begin{classdesc}{Canvas}{\optional{redraw_callback=None, event_callback=None}}
Constructs a \class{Canvas}. The optional parameters are callbacks
that are called when specific events occur. 

\note{Watch out for cyclic
references here. For example, if the callbacks are methods of an
object that holds a reference to the \class{Canvas}, a reference cycle
is formed that must be broken at cleanup time or the
\class{Canvas} will not be freed.}

\var{redraw_callback} is called whenever a part of the \class{Canvas} 
has been obscured by something, is then revealed, and needs to be
redrawn. This can typically happen, for example, when the user
switches away from the Python application and back again, or after
displaying a pop-up menu. The callback takes as its argument a
four-element tuple that contains the top-left and the bottom-right
corner of the area that needs to be redrawn. In many cases redrawing
the whole
\class{Canvas} is a reasonable option. 

\var{event_callback} is called whenever a raw key event is received.
There are three kinds of key events: \code{EEventKeyDown},
\code{EEventKey}, and \code{EEventKeyUp}. When a user presses a key 
down, events \code{EEventKeyDown} and \code{EEventKey} are generated. 
When the key is released, an \code{EEventKeyUp} event is generated.

The argument to the \var{event_callback} is a dictionary that contains 
the following data for key events:

\begin{itemize}
\item \code{'type'}: one of \code{EEventKeyDown}, \code{EEventKey}, or \code{EEventKeyUp}
\item \code{'keycode'}: the keycode of the key
\item \code{'scancode'}: the scancode of the key
\item \code{'modifiers'}: the modifiers that apply to this key event
\end{itemize}

Each key on the keyboard has one or more scancodes and zero or more keycodes 
associated with it. A scancode represents the physical key itself and a 
keycode is the result of state-related operating system defined processing 
done on the key. For keys that correspond to a symbol in the current 
character set of the phone, the keycode is equal to the code of the 
corresponding symbol in that character set. For example, if you are using 
the Nokia Wireless Keyboard (SU-8W), pressing the key A will always produce 
the scancode 65 (ASCII code for an upper case A), but the keycode 
could be either 65 or 91 (ASCII code for a lower case A) depending on 
whether or not the Shift key is pressed or Caps Lock is active. 

The \module{key_codes} module contains definitions for the keycodes and 
scancodes. See \figurename~\ref{fig:keyboard} for the codes of the most 
common keys on the phone keypad. 

Some keys are handled in a special way:

\begin{itemize}
\item A short press of the Edit key causes it to stay down, meaning that no \code{EEventKeyUp} event is sent. The event is only sent after a long press.
\item Detecting presses of the Voice tags key or the Power key is not supported.
\item If the right softkey is pressed, the \code{appuifw.app.exit_key_handler} callback is always executed.
\end{itemize}

There is no way to prevent the standard action of the Hang-up key, the Menu 
key, the Power key or the Voice tags key from taking place.
